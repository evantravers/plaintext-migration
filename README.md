# Migrating my vimwiki to zettelkasten

Things That I'd Have to Extract/Transform for ZK

## Transformations

- [x] Devotional Notes
- [x] `/notes/`
- [x] Diary
- [x] Booknotes
- [x] Links

I'm writing ruby scripts for each, each dumps copies of the changed files into a "migrated" folder.

I'm going to have to start all over again… because the migrated files have duplicate ids thanks to faulty birth times.

## Culling for value

- [ ] Devotional Notes
- [ ] `/notes/`
- [ ] Diary
- [ ] Booknotes
- [ ] Links

I'll just open them up in buffers… if I think it's worth bringing into the zettelkasten, I'll run `:bd`, otherwise I'll run `:Delete` to remove the file.

## Extracting true ZK

- [ ] Devotional Notes
- [ ] `/notes/`
- [ ] Diary
- [ ] Booknotes
- [ ] Links

In the end, ZK means "one thought, one note." Many of these are going to need to be "extracted" into separate thoughts.
